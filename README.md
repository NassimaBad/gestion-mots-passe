# Password Manager Application

## Overview

This is a secure Password Manager application developed using JavaFX for the client-side graphical user interface (GUI) and Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for the communication between the client and the server. The application allows users to securely store, retrieve, update, search, and delete their passwords with strong security measures.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality with robust input validation.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed using SHA-256 with a salt before storage.
- **Password Encryption:** Stored password entries are encrypted using AES for enhanced data security.
- **Password Management:**
  - Add new password entries (website, username, encrypted password).
  - Update existing password entries.
  - Delete password entries.
  - List all stored and decrypted password entries.
  - **Search Feature:** Filter password entries by website or username.
- **Password Security & UX:**
  - Passwords are masked by default in the main view for enhanced security.
  - Toggle visibility (show/hide) for passwords in the table view.
  - Copy password to clipboard functionality for quick access.
  - Advanced error handling and user feedback (visual cues for input validation, status messages).
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Utilizes Java RMI for robust and distributed communication.
- **Data Persistence:** User credentials and password entries are persisted to local JSON files (`users.json`, `passwords.json`).
- **Modern User Interface:** Features a clean and intuitive design with improved aesthetics and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Maven** (for dependency management and build automation)
- **JavaFX 24.0.1** (for the GUI client)
- **Java RMI** (for client-server communication)
- **Jackson Databind** (for JSON serialization/deserialization)
- **JUnit 5** (for unit/functional testing)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher installed.
- Maven installed.
- Docker Desktop installed and running (for containerized deployment).

### Building the Project

Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `pom.xml` is located) in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file in the `target/` directory.

### Running the Application

The application consists of two main components: the **RMI Server** and the **JavaFX Client**. You can run them directly on your host machine or in Docker containers.

#### Option 1: Running on Host Machine (for development)

1.  **Running the RMI Server**

        Open a new terminal, navigate to the project root, and run the server:

        ```bash

    mvn exec:java@run-server
    ```

        This command will start the RMI server, which will listen for client connections on port `1099`.

2.  **Running the JavaFX Client**

        Open another new terminal (or use the same one after the server has started in the background), navigate to the project root, and run the client:

        ```bash

    mvn javafx:run
    ```

        This will launch the JavaFX GUI client application.

#### Option 2: Running with Docker (Recommended for deployment)

For instructions on how to build and run the application using Docker, please refer to the dedicated Docker documentation:

[./docker/docs/README-Docker.md](./docker/docs/README-Docker.md)

## Usage

1.  **Login/Register:** On the initial screen, you can either log in with existing credentials or register a new account. Robust input validation is applied during registration.
2.  **Password Management:** Once logged in, you can use the main interface to:
    - **Add Password:** Enter website, username, and password, then click "Add".
    - **Update Password:** Select an entry from the table, modify the fields, and click "Update".
    - **Delete Password:** Select an entry from the table and click "Delete".
    - **Search Passwords:** Use the search field to filter passwords by website or username.
    - **Refresh:** Click "Refresh" to reload the password list from the server.
3.  **Password Security & Interactivity:**
    - **Password Visibility:** In the password table, click the "👁️" (eye) icon next to a masked password to reveal it. Click again to hide it.
    - **Copy Password:** Click the "📋" (clipboard) icon next to a password in the table to copy it to your system's clipboard.
4.  **Logout:** Click the "Logout" button to return to the login screen.
